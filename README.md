Demo Page
----------------
http://twittermap-iypypaycq7.elasticbeanstalk.com/main


Required Environment and Software
-------------------------------------------------
This application is based on AWS Elasticbean Stalk and RDS. I used the following libraries: twitter4j.jar library, Google Map API v3, Apache commons-lang-3-3.3.2 library,  AWS SDK for java.


Description
----------------
This application shows twitter stream on a map according to the twitters' location. Now user could only see the historical twitters in the database. I will get to real time twitters later. Also support a heatmap layer, which will show the density of both the twitters in any area on the map. Users can select the keywords they want to query and click on the marker to see the content of the twitter.
